This resource is a Hunspell checker dictionary tailored for the Uyghur language, with its wordlist derived from [Uyghur Edit](https://github.com/gheyret/uyghuredit). Uyghur, a Turkic language, exhibits agglutinative characteristics. This linguistic feature presents a challenge for Hunspell, given its limitations with morphologically rich languages. Consequently, Hunspell may not be the most effective tool for parsing Uyghur morphology.
